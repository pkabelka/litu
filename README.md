# litu

This package provides a few useful utility functions mainly for slices.
Functions use Go 1.18 generics.

There is also a very simple generic unordered set implementation in
[set.go](set.go).

This package was inspired by [go-funk](https://github.com/thoas/go-funk) which
as of writing uses `reflect` instead of 1.18 generics.
